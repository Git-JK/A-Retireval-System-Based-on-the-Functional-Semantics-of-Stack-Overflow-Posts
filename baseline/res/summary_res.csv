how to return the response from an asynchronous call,"[['the a in ajax stands for asynchronous . that means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. in your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.', 14220323], [""keep in mind that if you're doing a cross-domain ajax call (by using jsonp) - you can't do it synchronously, the async flag will be ignored by jquery."", 30148405], ['thus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like ajax based calls etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.', 47043798], [""of course there are many approaches like synchronous request, promise, but from my experience i think you should use the callback approach. it's natural to asynchronous behavior of javascript. so, your code snippet can be rewrite a little different:"", 44935441], ['short answer: your foo() method returns immediately, while the $ajax() call executes asynchronously after the function returns. the problem is then how or where to store the results retrieved by the async call once it returns.', 32750752]]"
how to convert an int to string?,"[['some of the ways to convert string into int are as follows:', 54561825], ['if works for every format string, so you can convert float or double to string by using ""%g"", you can convert int to hex using ""%x"", and so on.', 32819876], ['if the change attempt fails – in this case, if you can try to convert the java string test to an int — the integer parseint process will throw a numberformatexception, which you must handle in a try/catch block.', 53228578], ['use function itoa() to convert an integer to a string', 52677014], [""i wrote this fast method to parse a string input into int or long. it is faster than the current jdk 11 integer.parseint or long.parselong. although, you only asked for int, i also included the long parser. the code parser below requires that the parser's method must be small for it to operate quickly. an alternative version is below the test code. the alternative version is pretty quick and it does not depend on the size of the class."", 54282976]]"
how can I prevent sql injection in php?,"[['security warning: this answer is not in line with security best practices. escaping is inadequate to prevent sql injection, use prepared statements instead. use the strategy outlined below at your own risk.
